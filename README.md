# Sales-Time-Series-Forecasting
ML Model for Store Sales

Sales time series forecasting is a critical aspect of retail analytics, allowing businesses to anticipate future demand and make informed decisions regarding inventory management, resource allocation, and strategic planning. In this project, we aim to develop accurate and reliable forecasting models using historical sales data collected from stores. The project workflow involves several key steps: data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model selection, model training, evaluation, and forecasting.
